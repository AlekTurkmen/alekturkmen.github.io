										<h3 style="color: #4acaa8 !important;">Experiences - Jaros, Baum & Bolles</h3>
										<p>[June 2022 - August 2022 , NYC]</p>
									</header>
									<p>Last summer (2022), I spent 10 weeks interning at <a href="https://www.jbb.com/" target="_blank">Jaros, Baum & Bolles’</a> NYC office. It was my first professional internship and I’m very grateful for having one in my freshman year. Thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-mehl-7a93772/" target="_blank">Walter Mehl</a> for helping me get an interview (he’s a Cooper alumnus).

                                        <br><br>Firstly, JB&B has a great company culture. For how small of a company they are (~400 employees in NYC) they operate like they have tons of extra resources for developing new future talent in their college interns. Although I don’t necessarily see myself pursuing a career in MEP or living in NYC after college, if however I did, I would definitely choose to work at JB&B. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>By the end of the 10 weeks, I ended up helping in the design (with limited supervision) of 5 Tenant fit-out projects using Autodesk Revit. Specifically, the project buildings I worked on were 540 Madison, One Bryant Park, One World Trade Center, Hallet Towers, and NYU’s Skirball Center. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>The process for designing commercial/residential fit-outs was unique to each building, some were for the construction of completely new buildings and some were just renovations of old existing buildings. I actually led several design tasks, this included branch circuiting, ductwork distribution, piping distribution, latent and sensible heat load calculations, static air pressure calculations, equipment selection and sizing, and sustainability analysis. Finally, the process also included professional communication with the construction, civil, and architectural firms. In order to do this, I would review my shop drawings, construction documents, construction administration of RFIs & client submittals to ensure all of my designs were being communicated properly to the other consulting firms. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Getting away from the design process, my favorite part of the internship was definitely the site visits. I got to go on 3 of them actually. The most impressive was the brand new David Geffen Concert Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts complex on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Each site visit I would see the barebones of what a building was made of before all of its furnishings and opening to the public eye. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>[Put picture of site visits here]
                                        
                                        <br><br>My supervisor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-lista-pe-51771550/" target="_blank">Tyler Lista</a>, was the greatest supervisor and mentor I could have asked for. Tyler is very passionate about MEP and it shows. He put so much of his time into teaching me and making sure I walked away from that internship with tons of industry knowledge and a firm grasp in HVAC. Supervisors like him that take the time to teach new hires like myself are what make the difference between a great and shitty internship. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>*A take away from this is to always ask as many questions as possible and to learn as much as possible at a job. Regardless of if you are a first year intern or a senior manager at a company, someone above you always knows more and can teach you.
