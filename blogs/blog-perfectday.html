									<p>I open my eyes, and I can see the sunrise. Without looking at the weather app I can tell it’s gonna be pretty good weather. I’m on my 20th floor studio apartment balcony and I’m criss-cross apple saucing on my outdoor coach. On my lap is the book I was just reading and just before this I was meditating. I love waking up super early to the sunrise and letting my brain warm up before I start work. There is something so natural to how the sun feels on my pajamas, it’s like I’m a plant photosynthesizing. Also, Andrew Huberman told me it has tons of health benefits. </p>

									<p>After I’ve read through about 30 pages of “Atomic Habits” by James Clear - I'll get out my laptop, grab a bagel, a banana, a gallon of Poland Spring and a nature valley bar, and start working on whatever I was doing the night before. I’m the CEO of my 20 employee startup called <span class="indent"></span>. Most of my work is management level, or what I like to call ‘The Macro’ work. The company has been bootstrapped in its entirety; and to this day, my co-founder <span class="indent"></span>, and I, have a 50-50 equity split in the company. </p>
									
									<p>Time flies fast when you're <s>working</s> having fun. By now it’s lunchtime and I have a client meeting at the local coffee shop. The client’s name is <span class="indent"></span> and he's one of my biggest supporters and fans in the company. We talk a bit, and at this point in my life, I have excellent people skills and can convince people easily. He has major connections with product distributions in the US and after a bit of share negotiations he agrees to sell my product in <span class="indent"></span> and <span class="indent"></span>.</p>

									<p>After the coffee chat, I head over to the gym. The gym is my happy place. It serves as a great mediator between the two sections of working hours I have. One cold shower later and I’m back into work. My <s>first</s> <s>second</s> third cup of coffee for the day is now at my desk and I sip it slowly. The rest of the day is consistent work up until about 7 or 8 pm. Everyone in my life knows that I can’t be reached until 8 pm, since that’s when I “get off work”. I like to think that I can disconnect from work but realistically there’s always something to do involving the company. My company has fully consumed the free space in my brain, but that’s exactly how I like it.</p>

									<p>Some nights I’ll stay up all night just grinding since I have this burning idea on my mind. Those nights usually start out with 30 minutes of restless sleep where my brain just keeps thinking. Publicly, I get around 7-8 hours of sleep, but just between you and me, it’s more like 5-6. There’s just something so satisfying about working late into the night. I’m either a night owl by birth or it’s the college studying nostalgia I just can’t shake. </p>

									<p>Although I have a set schedule, I try to always change things up. Habits are good, but autopilot is horrible. Novelty keeps me from burning out. I have built in checkpoints every month where I check in on my progress and assess how efficient I am. My team and I meet at the end of each week to perform a Weekly Check In, the tally right now is W.C.I. #237. This week in our online weekly check in, <span class="indent"></span> fell asleep on camera and we all had the funniest time trying to wake them up. When <span class="indent"></span> finally woke up they chimed into the conversation like nothing happened and we all started dying laughing again. I love the people I work with. </p>

									<p>I don’t have a girlfriend and I don’t have any pets. But I do have a group of like-minded friends and mentors that I like to go out with on occasion. The majority of my friends are people in the startup industry. Younger, older, the same age, they all support me and I support them. In the most cliche way possible, it took me a while to find “my people” but I’m glad I finally did. </p>
