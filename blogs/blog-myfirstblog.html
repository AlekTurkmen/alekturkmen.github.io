									<h4>Introduction to myself</h4>
									<p>Hi, my name is Alek Turkmen. I’m currently 20 years old and I’m about to go into my junior year of college at The Cooper Union. I’ve always loved math, science and problem solving, but I was never able to pinpoint a precise career interest so I decided to study mechanical engineering as a broad way to encompass my interests. I am very curious by nature and one of the first things someone notices when getting to know me is how straightforward I am. </p>
									<p>I’m originally from Istanbul, Turkey (although I was born in the States) so I have a pretty holistic view of the world and get along well with international people, not just natives. My first language was Turkish but since I moved to the US when I was 7, I’ve since forgotten most of it and my English is so good you wouldn’t be able to tell it wasn’t my first language.</p>
									<p>I’m introverted by nature, however I’m a better extrovert. I like to think I’ve struck a great balance between the two since I can be the life of a party, but I prefer to be alone. Speaking of being alone, I really think it's important to be able to think in one's consciousness for extended periods of time without getting bored. I get my ideas, direction and (trying not to sound braggy but also) my intelligence from how disciplined my mind is. Discipline in my opinion goes hand in hand with motivation, and speaking of which I would like to talk about… </p>
									<hr />
									<h4>What makes me motivated</h4>
									<p>Motivation doesn’t just come from nowhere. There is always a source to someone’s motivation. It might be that someone is just trying to provide for their family. Someone is trying to look physically beach ready for their vacation. Or some people are motivated by the chance of making someone else’s life better. Whatever it may be, everyone has their motivation, there are no exceptions to this and no matter what you can find something out there to be stellar.</p>
									<p>I’ve been very motivated as a result of my upbringing. My father is a disciplined and extremely stubborn man, he is stubborn to the point of compulsion and a good portion of that has rubbed off on me. It’s taken me a very long time to realize the value his upbringing had on me and the mindset it’s induced on me. </p>
									<p>Both sides of my family ancestry worked their asses off to get me the life I have and I feel like it would be a complete disservice to my ancestors to be anything but average in my lifespan.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>What I see my future as</h4>
									<p>As I said before, I really enjoy math and science. And I have no doubt that what I settle on in life is going to be related to those two. </p>
									<p>I love space. Specifically, space exploration. I’ve watched countless hours of the popular television series "Cosmos" as a kid with my Dad. My dream job would be working for a leading edge space company like SpaceX or NASA. </p>
									<p>I love the idea of being my own boss. I’ve worked 3 separate paid internships by now and unless I have a big role in the company or have major decision making power I tend to not like having to work my way up from ground level. People have told me that ‘that’s just the way a job goes’ ‘you have to earn more responsibilities and that takes time’. This makes me want to be an entrepreneur or involve myself in startups. I want to be at the leading-edge of technology and grind for a purpose. I have a fire in me that allows me to work hard at the things I do, and if I’m willing to sacrifice 10 years of my life working day and night I better not just get a scheduled promotion like everyone else who works there. I want to put my career into my own hands and be able to reap the benefits after having outworked others. </p>
									<hr />
									<h4>Why I belive in myself</h4>
									<p>I tend to make many more mistakes than the average person. I like making mistakes. I learn from them, then adapt. I’m also not scared to try new things. It compliments making mistakes and speeds up the learning process.</p>
									<p>I bring a unique persona to engineering. Most engineers are geniuses, but when it comes to social ability they usually fall short. Here’s where I come in. I’m a great engineer and an even better socializer. </p>
									<hr />
									<p>I hope you enjoyed this blog and hopefully this opened a window into my life. </p>
