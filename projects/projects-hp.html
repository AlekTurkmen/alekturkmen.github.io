										<h3 style="color: #86cdcf !important;">Heat Pump Rig</h3>
										<p>January - May 2024</p>
									</header>
									<p>I took a class called ME-360: Engineering Experiments junior spring semester. Our final project was a tabletop sized heat pump rig.</p>
									<h4>Context</h4>
									<p>We were assigned to: <br> Build and design a tabletop heat pump rig with readable parameters to measure the work, efficiency, and various specifications of the closed loop system based on varying compressor speeds.</p>							
									<p>To get event more technical: <br>Research, design, review, part orders, build, and modify a tabletop heat pump rig that will be used for educational purposes. The rig will have readable parameters to measure work, efficiency, mass flow rate, temperature, pressure, rpm, coefficient of performance, enthalpy, entropy, quality, and phase of (1) refrigerant loop and (2) water loops. These readable parameters will be compared to varying compressor speeds for students to better understand optimization of heat pump systems. And most importantly it needs to be safe, the refrigerant we were using (as environmentally conscious as it was) is extremely flammable and must be handle by a licensed professional.</p>
									<p>If you come from an engineering or engineering parallel background feel free to <a href="#product-development-section">skip</a> this section. But if you want to learn a little bit more about how a heat pump works the below sections will bring you up to speed. </p>
									<h3>How Does A Heat Pump Work? (In 5 Levels Of Increasing Complexity)</h3>
									<h4>Level 1 - Overview</h4>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
										<div class="col-12" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
										  <span class="image fit" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
											<img src="../images/HP/Level1.png" alt="Level 1" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
										  </span>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Our heat pump has 3 closed off loops that run counter flow to each other. The arrows represent the direction of flow. The central loop is filled with a mostly liquid refrigerant. And the loops on the left and right are water loops (left is hot water, right is cold water). Where the loops meet, is where all the energy transfer happens. A heat pump is a constant cycle of removing the right side of its heat and supplying the left side with that heat.  </p>
									<h4>Level 2 - Overview</h4>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
										<div class="col-12" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
										  <span class="image fit" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
											<img src="../images/HP/Level2.png" alt="Level 2" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
										  </span>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>A better way of describing this heat is with thermal and electrical energy. As the saying goes, “you have to spend money to make money” this also applies to heat pumps in that “in order to move heat you must first add more heat to the system.” </p>
									<p>I want to first point your attention to the electric energy being inputted into the system. You might be asking yourself, why on Earth are we adding electrical energy? The electrical energy is what keeps the refrigerant flowing and makes sure the heat keeps moving through the system. </p>
									<p>A cool way of thinking of this is when you touch a cold piece of metal. It’s cold to the touch because it’s pulling heat out of your hand. I think I’m crazy for this but a good conceptual way to understand thermodynamics is to think of the cold being pulled from your hand and simultaneously pretend to be the cold piece of metal being touched by a hot human hand. </p>
									<p>If you have a keen eye, you’ll have noticed that the energy input is equal to the energy output.</p>
									<code style="display: inline-block; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
										Input Q<sub>Cooling</sub> (910 W) + W<sub>Electric</sub> (360 W) = Q<sub>Heating</sub> (1270 W)*
									</code>
									<p style="font-size: 12px;">*This is ideal, meaning it won’t actually be 100% efficient like this in the real world.</p>
									
									<h4>Level 3 - Overview</h4>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
										<div class="col-12" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
										  <span class="image fit" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
											<img src="../images/HP/Level3.png" alt="Level 3" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

									</div>
									<p>The heat pump compression cycle involves four key components, each integral to its operation. Beginning with the compressor (top of the diagram), it pressurizes the refrigerant, elevating its temperature to facilitate efficient heat exchange. From there, the refrigerant flows into the condenser, where it releases heat to the surrounding environment, undergoing a phase change from vapor to liquid. Following the condenser, the expansion valve regulates the refrigerant's flow, reducing its pressure and temperature as it enters the evaporator. Finally, in the evaporator, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the designated space, completing the cycle by transitioning back into a vapor state for recirculation through the compressor. </p>

									<h4>Level 4 - Stages</h4>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
										<div class="col-12" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
										  <span class="image fit" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
											<img src="../images/HP/Level4.png" alt="Level 4" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
										  </span>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>In the heat pump compression cycle, the refrigerant passes through distinct phases. In Stage 1, the Superheated Vapor phase, the refrigerant exits the compressor as a high-temperature, high-pressure vapor. In Stage 2, the Subcooled Liquid phase, it cools in the condenser, reducing its temperature while maintaining pressure. In Stage 3, the Liquid Mixture phase, the refrigerant passes through the expansion valve, lowering its temperature and pressure. Finally, in Stage 4, the Saturated Vapor phase, it absorbs heat in the evaporator, maintaining constant temperature and pressure, preparing for compression again.</p>
									<p>In the expansion valve a phase change occurs, meaning a substantial amount of the liquid refrigerant turns into vapor. This process is called latent heat, which changes the phase of the substance without changing its temperature. This allows for the transfer of large amounts of energy with relatively small temperature changes.</p>

									<h4>Level 5 - Enthalpy (aka the final boss of thermodynamics)</h4>
									<p>Kicking the assess of every college engineer that learns about it for the first time, enthalpy has an undefeated track record against college engineers who attempt having a solid conceptual understanding of what it means in the first place. </p>
									<p>Here is my best attempt and vaguely defining it. Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a system, including both its internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. </p>
									<p>I bring this up because that’s how we found how much work was being done back at Level 2. Full circle moments are cool. </p>
									
									<h3 id="product-development-section">Product Development</h3>
									<h4>Why Heat Pumps?</h4>
									<p>They are more efficient than traditional heating or air conditioning methods. </p>

									<h4>Design</h4>
									<p>Our initial design laid out the separation and formatting we wanted the rig to have. This rig is intended to be used for educational purposes in the future so our aim was not to optimize how much space it took up, so spacing things out would give us more room for graphics and readable parameters. </p>
